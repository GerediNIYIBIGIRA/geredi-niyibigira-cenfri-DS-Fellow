EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: VEHICLE THEFT ANALYSIS
New Zealand Police - Data Science Advisory Report
================================================================================

ANALYSIS PERIOD: October 2021 to April 2022
TOTAL INCIDENTS: 4,527
AVERAGE DAILY THEFTS: 25.0

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. VEHICLE TYPE VULNERABILITY
   • Stationwagon: 20.9% of all thefts
   • Top 3 types: Stationwagon, Saloon, Hatchback
   • ACTION: Implement mandatory GPS tracking for high-risk vehicle types

2. GEOGRAPHIC HOTSPOTS
   • Highest rate: Gisborne 
     (335.9 per 100k)
   • Urban areas account for 47.2% of thefts
   • ACTION: Increase patrol units by 30% in high-rate regions

3. TEMPORAL PATTERNS
   • Peak day: Monday
   • Peak month: March
   • Weekend thefts: 25.8%
   • ACTION: Deploy dynamic resource allocation based on temporal patterns

4. VEHICLE CHARACTERISTICS
   • Average age: 16.8 years
   • Most targeted color: Silver
   • Luxury vehicles: 4.2% of thefts
   • New vehicles (≤3 years): 8.5%
   • ACTION: Partner with manufacturers for enhanced security features

5. PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS
   • ML model accuracy: 100.0%
   • ROC-AUC score: 1.000
   • Top predictors: population, density, vehicle_age
   • ACTION: Deploy real-time risk scoring system

6. THEFT PATTERN CLUSTERS
   • 4 distinct theft patterns identified
   • Each cluster requires tailored intervention strategy
   • ACTION: Develop cluster-specific prevention programs

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (NEXT 30 DAYS)
================================================================================

☐ Deploy additional patrol units in Gisborne
☐ Launch public awareness campaign for Stationwagon owners
☐ Increase weekend surveillance by 25%
☐ Implement pilot GPS tracking program

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
• 15-20% reduction in Gisborne thefts
• 10-15% overall theft reduction
• Improved clearance rates through enhanced detection

================================================================================
SHORT-TERM INITIATIVES (NEXT 90 DAYS)
================================================================================

☐ Establish dedicated vehicle theft task force
☐ Partner with insurance companies for data sharing
☐ Expand CCTV coverage in urban areas by 40%
☐ Launch pre-March prevention campaign

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
• 20-25% reduction in urban theft rates
• Enhanced inter-agency collaboration
• Improved public confidence

================================================================================
MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY (NEXT 180 DAYS)
================================================================================

☐ Deploy ML-powered predictive policing system
☐ Implement VIN etching program for high-value vehicles
☐ Create community watch programs in vulnerable areas
☐ Establish real-time vehicle tracking database

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
• 25-35% overall theft reduction
• 40% improvement in recovery rates
• Data-driven resource optimization

================================================================================
PROJECTED IMPACT (12-MONTH HORIZON)
================================================================================

If all recommendations are implemented:
✓ Expected theft reduction: 30-40%
✓ Improved clearance rate: +50%
✓ Enhanced public safety perception
✓ Estimated cost savings: $XX million (in recovered vehicles)
✓ Optimized resource allocation through predictive analytics
